# Challenge: ToDo List

Using what you have learnt over these work sheets work out how to make a to-do list toolâ€¦

## The to-do list tool should be able to:

1. Accept new to-do items through an input field and then store it in [Local Storage](03-local-storage.md)
2. Display a list of each of the items in the to-do list
3. Allow the user to complete a task - this would remove the item from LocalStorage

## Stretch goals

- Could you make the list keep the completed tasks, but visually show that they are complete?
- If you have done the `HTML` and `CSS` course; could you add `CSS` to improve the layout and design of the to-do list?
