# Challenge: Scoreboard

Create a score board where a user can create a list of names and then keep a running count of the score in a game.

## The scoreboard should be able to:

1. Accept a list of players
2. One game can have multiple rounds, each round will have a score per user
3. Display a running total at the end

## Stretch goals

- If a user gets negative points in a round, or in total visually show that.
- When the game ends, reorder the list with the winner at the top and the loser at the bottom


If you've done all that, well done! You've run out of things! Maybe you find a way to improve one of your challenges with even more features?
